# fix-this

You know when you need to Sugru something but you won't use a whole packet and you don't want to waste it? You don't do it and wait until you have a few things to fix at once. You don't write down the things because you'll remember them, won't you. But you don't.

This app is basically a to-do list app for Android. But it's designed specifically for making lists of things to Sugru in the simplest way possible. See...

## Opening the app the first time

This is rougly what the Home screen will look like: [Home screen mockups](https://github.com/lauracowen/fix-this/blob/master/Fix%20This%20app%20designs/latest-exported-pngs/1%20-%20Home.png)

1. When you first open it and there's nothin in your list.
2. When you have added several items (things you want to Sugru) to the list by taking photos of them.
3. When you have added several items to the list, some with photos and some without.

## Adding an item to the list by taking a photo

[See mockup](https://github.com/lauracowen/fix-this/blob/master/Fix%20This%20app%20designs/latest-exported-pngs/2%20-%20Add%20item%20by%20taking%20photo.png)

1. On the Home screen, press the 'new photo item' button on the top bar (shown by the pink marker in the drawing).
2. The Camera is opened (can be either portrait or landscape).
3. Press the shutter button to take a photo of something that you want to fix with Sugru.
4. The taken photo is previewed on the screen and you have the option to save it or to try again and take another photo.
5. When you're happy with the photo and have clicked Save, you're returned to the Home screen and your photo is displayed as a new item in your list.

And that's all you need to do to add something to the list.

## Viewing the details of an item in the list

[See mockup](https://github.com/lauracowen/fix-this/blob/master/Fix%20This%20app%20designs/latest-exported-pngs/3%20-%20View%20details%20of%20an%20entry.png)

1. Touch the item in your list that you want to view in more detail (eg in the area shown by the pink marker).
2. You're taken into a 'details' view where you can see the name and any other details set for the item (eg the colour of Sugru required, the proportion of a packet required).

As I said earlier, adding an item to the list doesn't require a whole lot of detail so there might be very little shown in the 'details' view.

## Editing the details of an item in the list

[See mockup](https://github.com/lauracowen/fix-this/blob/master/Fix%20This%20app%20designs/latest-exported-pngs/4%20-%20Edit%20details%20of%20an%20entry.png)

1. On the Home screen again, touch the Edit icon on the item in the list that you want to edit.
2. You're taken into the 'edit details' view where you can type a meaningful name for the item, you can do minor edits to the photo, you can add more photos (which are shown in the 'details' view by swiping sideways), you can select a colour and quantity of Sugru, and you can add extra notes. None of this is required if you can't be bothered to enter it.

# Background

My Mum uses Sugru and she keeps spotting things she wants to fix but doesn't write them down. I know others (including myself) who do the same thing.

I'm (very slowly) learning to program Java.

Together, those aims became a design for an Android app. Implementation progress will probably be slow but feel free to comment and give feedback on the designs/usability or the code, or both.

The slight catch is that my Mum has an iPhone. If I can make the Android version and find it useful, maybe someone will be inspired to port it to iPhone (I'll even attempt the designs if I can).

# Wishlist

Some ideas that I'm not including from the start but which would be cool later (assuming I get that far!).

* Based on the estimated quantities (if given) in the details of an item, the app will notify you when you've added enough items in that colour to use up a full packet.
* When you mark an item as done (ie you've done the Sugru fix), you're prompted to take a photo of the finished fix so that you have before and after pics.
* When you mark an item as done, you're given the option to 'share' your fix. This would be in the normal social media way but also, if you've got before and after photos, by email to submit it to the Sugru gallery.
* Buy packets of Sugru through thte app.
* Widget for your phone's homescreen?
